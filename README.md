# Vulnerability Scanning Tool

This Python-based **Vulnerability Scanning Tool** helps identify open ports and gather system information for a given IP address. It scans devices or networks for potential vulnerabilities by detecting open ports and exposed services.

## Features:
- Gathers system information (e.g., OS, software).
- Scans for open ports on the target IP.
- Helps identify security risks related to unpatched services or exposed ports.

## Usage:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the `vulnerability_scanner.py` script.
3. Enter the target IP address when prompted to begin scanning.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Nmap installed on your system for port scanning

**Note**: Use responsibly on networks or devices you own or have explicit permission to scan.
